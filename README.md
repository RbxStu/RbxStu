# StudioExecutor

A simple studio executor, able to access CoreGui with Level 8 permissions.

Has a small set of custom functions meant to be used to pentest your game.

Full Disclosure: This project was made for the purposes of testing things like Anti-Cheats and pen-testing your own games. It is MADE for Roblox Studio. Most of the things used here may not be applicable to the ACTUAL Roblox Client, as most of the functions this uses (such as luau_load) are inlined on the Client, but not on Studio.
